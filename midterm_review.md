# Midterm Reflection

For the first two problems I forgot to add checks for empty or missing inputs like `None` or empty strings. Now I made sure to include length checks like `len(string) > 0` so I would avoid any errors.

In problem 3 I again didn’t validate whether the input had any usable characters. To fix this I added proper verification before processing the string.

Problem 4 gave me some issues with things like unnecessary logic—like using `abs()` when it wasn’t needed. I simplified the approach and made it more efficient.

In problem 5 I did not use proper control structures before so I skipped safety checks. This time I made better use of `for` loops and string handling. I also used Python more confidently and didn’t oversimplify the solution which made me understand it better.

In overall I can say I improved by writing safer code and thinking more carefully about structure and logic. I will definitely be applying more safeguards and being clearer about how each function handles edge cases.
